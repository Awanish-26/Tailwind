To start tailwind postprocessor-----
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./assets/css/output.css -w

To deploy your static Tailwind project on GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Create a GitHub repository: If you haven't already, create a new repository on GitHub to host your project.

2. Set up your project: Ensure that your project structure is set up correctly. Make sure you have an `index.html` file and any other necessary assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) in the appropriate directories.

3. Install npm packages: If you haven't already, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Build your project: Since you're using Tailwind CSS, you need to build your project to generate the final optimized CSS file. In your terminal, run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This command will compile your Tailwind CSS code and create a minified CSS file.

5. Configure your build settings: Open your `package.json` file and add the following lines under the `"scripts"` section:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "build": "tailwindcss build ./path/to/your/tailwind.css -o ./path/to/output.css"
   }
   ```

   Replace `"./path/to/your/tailwind.css"` with the path to your Tailwind CSS file (usually `./src/tailwind.css`), and `"./path/to/output.css"` with the path where you want the final CSS file to be generated (usually `./dist/output.css`).

6. Create a branch named `gh-pages`: In your terminal, run the following command to create a new branch named `gh-pages`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b gh-pages
   ```

7. Commit and push your changes: Add and commit your project files to the `gh-pages` branch, and then push the branch to your GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push origin gh-pages
   ```

8. Enable GitHub Pages: Go to your GitHub repository's settings, and under the "GitHub Pages" section, set the source branch to `gh-pages`. Save the changes.

9. Verify your deployment: GitHub will provide you with a link to access your deployed project. It may take a few minutes for the changes to propagate. You can visit the provided link to verify that your project is successfully deployed on GitHub Pages.

That's it! Your static Tailwind project should now be deployed and accessible via GitHub Pages.
